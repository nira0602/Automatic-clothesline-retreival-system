The Automated Clothesline Retrieval System is designed to automatically retrieve clothes from a clothesline based on weather conditions. Integrated with the OpenWeather API, this system monitors real-time weather data, such as rain, wind speed, and temperature, to determine when it is appropriate to bring the clothes inside to prevent damage. This smart system can be deployed in homes, laundromats, or other areas where clotheslines are used.

Features
Weather-Based Retrieval: Uses real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API to determine if conditions are unfavorable for drying clothes (e.g., rain, high winds).
Automated Operation: Automatically activates a motorized system to retrieve clothes from the line when weather conditions require it.
Real-Time Weather Monitoring: Continuously checks weather conditions to ensure the system operates at optimal times.
